We decided to create a security system based on facial recognition and machine learning to create unique facial profiles for users that can be used as passkeys. The device was based off of the RaspberryPi micro computer. I created the machine learning software in Python to scan a user&#39;s face, record a video and chop it into hundreds of frames. Each frame becomes an array of features to train the machine learning model and is referenced in real time via the camera connected to the Pi to determine if the user should be granted access to the system or not. I made use of the public python library Sci-kit learn for this project. </div><div class="custom-project-img-bundler"><img src="'+n+'" class="h-80 rounded-lg relative"><a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/cag185/Facial-Recognition">Github Link</a></div></div></div><div class="project-container"><div class="custom-subtitle py-10">Personal Photography Website</div><div class="custom-information-text-container"><div class="custom-project-information-text"> Photoraphy has always been a hobby of mine.

I was playing a lot of Wordle, and thought to myself this would be easy to create a program to do this for me. A few hours later, I had a program that could make use of a dictionary and some basic process of elimination to allow the user a pretty good shot of solving the Wordle of the day within its maximum 5 guesses. Using Python and the command line, you can play the game with Wordle and your computer! A cool expansion to this command line game would be to host a site where the user can play this online, with a backend application connected. This could remain in python, or I could change the language since it&#39;s a pretty simple idea, and I could add some creative flair to the front end design to entertain the user. </div><div class="custom-project-img-bundler"><img src="'+c+'" class="h-72 rounded-lg relative"><a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/cag185/WordleHelper">Github Link</a></div></div></div><div class="project-container"><div class="custom-subtitle py-10">Simulated Train System Application</div><div class="custom-information-text-container"><div class="custom-project-information-text"> Trains, the bane of existence for a sophomore/junior computer engineer at the University Of Pittsburgh. This semester long class was based around a grueling group project where we designed and simulated a working train software system. Our professor was a train engineer at the local train company in Pittsburgh, and used his full expreience to simualte a company wanting to bring on a team to run through the entire design process. In this class we learned about the Agile methodology, working in a team, creating deliverables every week, managing sprints, and talking directly to the stakeholder (in this case, our professor). We learned quickly that often the customer can say they need one thing and in reality need something different. Our profressor was intintailly vague about the requirements of his product, forcing the development team to dig in and ask questions, adopting an iterative design pattern, and creating documents such as a Software Development Document that outline deliveriables that shall be met. I was personally responsible for creating the Track Model for the system. Some key responsiblilites included loading a dynamic user interface to view stats about the various track models (elevation, outside temp, switch locations, etc), editing mutable settings to see how the enviornment would react, parse CVS information about any track file to be loaded into the system, and pass relevant information between modules that other teammates were responsible for (including a Track Controller, Train Controller, Train Model, and CTC office). The stack used was javascript and typescript as well as electron and eslinter. </div><div class="custom-project-img-bundler"><img src="'+l+'" class="h-80 rounded-lg relative"><a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/ctrlaltf2/trains">Github Link</a></div></div></div><div class="project-container"><div class="custom-subtitle py-10">C++ Multi-level Cache Simulation with Heirarchy</div><div class="custom-information-text-container"><div class="custom-project-information-text"> This project was a combination of a college software project and passion idea that I had.
