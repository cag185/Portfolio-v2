Over the summer I was exposed to a multitude of projects, including our E-commerce website, the Point Of Sales Machine, our API, and the administration management site. I was hired on as a Full Stack software engineer before I gradutated college, and did part time work through my final semeseter of college. Since graduation, I have helped with a complete overhaul of the admin management site, with an updated tech stack to help produce cleaner and more effecient code. I have had a hand in getting the project off the ground and the majority of my work entails producing features for and providing support for this app. I also work on the API side, using EF core and Dotnet to perform CRUD operations on the entities we use to manage orders, accounts, users, and items. The majority of the tech stack I use on a daily basis is Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, Docker, SQL database, C#/Dotnet, and Azure Dev ops for Git control and task management. </div></div><div><div class="custom-subtitle font-bold">SMS Group</div><div class="custom-dates">July-2021 | March-2022</div><div class="custom-information-text"> My time at SMS group as a computer engineering co-op taught me some basic front end development skills. We also used C# and Dotnet for the backend, where I learned about Model-View-viewModel patterns. I mostly helped work on the Human Machine interface, which was a pretty large product that helped Steel Manufacturing plants control equipment that our company created software to automate. I also worked on a few smaller excel VBA and python scripts to help with our Task management, as well as migrate our workflow from Gitea to Gitlabs. </div></div></div>',3)]))}const l=t(n,[["render",i]]);export{l as default};
