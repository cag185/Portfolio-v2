      I have spent some time creating some personal projects both for college classes as well as for
      fun! Some of these were created during my time at Pitt and some have been revisited after.

        This project was a combination of a college software project and passion idea that I had. I
        created a react native app that uses Expo Go to host on my local machine and display on my
        iPhone. The app is a bucket-list tracker which displays the country's national parks and
        information about them, allows the user to add to one of two lists: Want-to-visit and
        been-there. The basic app is more or less a todo-list, but with my current full-stack
        knowledge I plan on taking it into a new direction: An outdoor-centric national park social
        media. The app will feature account creation, user posts and the connection between user
        accounts via friending.
