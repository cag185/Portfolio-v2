        I am a 24 year old Full-Stack developer based in Pittsburgh, PA. I have a few years of web
        development under my belt, using frameworks like React and Vue, as well as experience in C#
        for backend development. I use SQL, Docker, EF Core, and occasionally Laravel. For the front
        end, I use mostly Vue.js with TailwindCSS for stylizing. I am currently working at The
        Restaurant Store as a dev for many projects, including an e-commerce website. My interests
        are in robotics, web development, automation, and embedded systems.
