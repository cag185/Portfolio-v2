          I started off at the Restaurant store as an intern in software engineering. Over the
          summer I was exposed to a multitude of projects, including our E-commerce website, the
          Point Of Sales Machine, our API, and the administration management site. I was hired on as
          a Full Stack software engineer before I gradutated college, and did part time work through
          my final semeseter of college. Since graduation, I have helped with a complete overhaul of
          the admin management site, with an updated tech stack to help produce cleaner and more
          effecient code. I have had a hand in getting the project off the ground and the majority
          of my work entails producing features for and providing support for this app. I also work
          on the API side, using EF core and Dotnet to perform CRUD operations on the entities we
          use to manage orders, accounts, users, and items. The majority of the tech stack I use on
          a daily basis is Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, Docker, SQL database, C#/Dotnet, and Azure Dev ops
          for Git control and task management.

          My time at SMS group as a computer engineering co-op taught me some basic front end
          development skills. We also used C# and Dotnet for the backend, where I learned about
          Model-View-viewModel patterns. I mostly helped work on the Human Machine interface, which
          was a pretty large product that helped Steel Manufacturing plants control equipment that
          our company created software to automate. I also worked on a few smaller excel VBA and
          python scripts to help with our Task management, as well as migrate our workflow from
          Gitea to Gitlabs.
